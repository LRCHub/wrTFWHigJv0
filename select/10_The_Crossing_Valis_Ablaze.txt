Just let go
Seek that sweet release
Outside the warning light
A new collision

Festhers and leaves are swiftly removed
Falter in the light
Something dark begins to stir
The new condition
Sink

Sink

Into a world that you create
Built so you assimilate in cycles
Hidden messages dispersed
Ache and love with constant thirst

Fearing this momentum
Calling out to you as echoes
Swim in emotion
Bring in to focus below
Into a world that you create
Born so you assimilate in cycles
Hidden messages dispersed
Ache and love with constant thirst
Sink
It filters through the atmosphere
Reaching for the new frontier
Descending across a sea of stars tonight
A boundless exploration ignites
Just let go of the world
Fade away inside
And sink
