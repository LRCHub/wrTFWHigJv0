Our past was never perfect
We've made mistakes
along the way
We've taken too many turns
when the road was straight
So that the way could last a
little longer
The end of the road is looming
ahead
And I pray to find way for me to
make the clock reset
I pray that our time could
last another day
As long as the flowers
in this room
Continue to stay
in bloom for you
Together we'll run until was
reach the end
You promised me
you'd never let me go
You promised me you'd always
stay with me
if I'm by your side,
you said you'd breathe for me
But in your eyes you stay
you have to go
You're crying tears
that only I can see
Don't let it go
Don't let the light go
The future is never perfect
It's always harder than it seems
There's no one to prove to us
what's wrong or right
We need to find the answer for
tomorrow
In the end we know
with every obstracle
We grow a little wiser
and we rise up stronger yet
Our moment to shine is
sure to come
As long as
the flowers in this room
Continue to stay
in bloom for you
Together we'll write a better
story's end
I promised you
I'd never let you go
I promised you
I'd always stay with you
If you're by my side,
I'd be the breath in you
But deep inside
I'm scared to let you go
I don't know
how to make it on my own
I want you to know
I want you to know now
Pray, forever and always
Stay, forever and always
You, such a beatiful memory
will remain alive in this moment
Pray, forever and always
Stay, forever and always
Life, even if it should
leave you
Love, will never be broken
As gentry as
the final petal falls
You close your eyes as
if you're in a sleep
It's then that I know
The crossing is here
You promised me
you'd never let me go
You promised me
you'd always stay with me
if I'm by your side, you said
you'd breathe for me
But even if this moment has
come to pass
And even if there words
will by my last
I won't say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
